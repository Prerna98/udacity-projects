  -->if player collide with enemy it again comes to the position from where it starts.

how i managed to design this game?
  first of all,it took a lot of time to understand  the full code that was given and what i need to do.
  then i again watched the videos,start doing it.
  i read engine,app file again and again to understand whats going on.
  then i started writing code,and things started working out slowly.

 My experience- 
  my experience was so awesome.i have never done something like this.
  and  i spent my  whole day thinking how to move them how to collide them.
  and when finally they started moving i felt so good.

to run the game:-
 open the index.html file in the browser.
 then welcome messsage appears on the screen.
 then enter the player name. game will dislpay on the screen.
